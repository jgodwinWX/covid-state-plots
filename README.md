# covid-state-plots
A quick plotter for COVID-19 cases by U.S. state. Could be easily adapted for countries, provinces, or other geographies.

The x-axis plots the number of days since a state's nth case (n can be set by the user by changing the case_limit variable). The y-axis is the total cumulative number of cases (using a log scale).
